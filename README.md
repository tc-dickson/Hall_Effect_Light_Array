# Project Title
A custom, fan-mounted circuit designed to pulse rotating lights by detecting a magnet mounted to the rim of the fan.

## Overview
This project was the culmination of my introductory circuits class while in college. The goal was to design an LED-driving, battery-operated circuit using Op-Amps and controlled via an Arduino. Control input was to come from a hall-effect sensor detecting the presence or absence of a magnetic field. While many of these parts were provided as a kit, freedom was given to design and program the circuit. It was a lot of fun putting it together and working out the bugs in both hardware and software. Once the circuit was assembled, I was able to mount it on the fan and enjoyed watching the patterns created by the pulsed lights. Overall, it was a challenging project that involved circuit design and manufacture, software development, and troubleshooting--A small showcase of the engineering design methodology.
